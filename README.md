# Merriam Webster's Thesaurus app

Welcome to my Merriam Webster's Thesaurus app.
This app fecthes some data from the <a href="https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-thesaurus" target="_blank">Merriam Webster CollegiateÂ® Thesaurus API</a>, and presents it in a UI which tries to mimic the original online <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus">Merriam Webster Thesaurus</a>. Of course, all it has been done with no profit intend, just as a programming practise. Therefore, all credit for the data and the original UI goes to Merriam Webster (copyright).
Backend: NodeJS, Express JS, Axios.
Frontend: EJS, Bootstrap 5.
